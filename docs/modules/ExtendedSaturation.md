ExtendedSaturation
==================

The icon for this module is beef.

When enabled any food eaten has is saturation multiplied by the configured multiplier.

When disabled food works like regular food.

### Configuration

This module takes an extra configuration value:

```yaml
multiplier: 2.5
```

This is the number to multiply the saturation value by. The above configuration makes
all food give 2 1/2 times the usual saturation value.
