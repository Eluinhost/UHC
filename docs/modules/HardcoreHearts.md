==============

This icon for this module is roses.

This module will not load unless ProtocolLib is installed and is not disableable. 

This module will not load if the [AutoRespawn](AutoRespawn.md) module is not
loaded and will force AutoRespawn to be enabled and will stop it from being disabled.
This fixes a bug with how hardcore works in 1.8 and is essential to stop
problems from occuring.
