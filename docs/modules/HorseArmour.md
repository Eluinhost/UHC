HorseArmour
===========

The icon for this module is diamond horse armour.

When enabled this module does nothing.

On disable all players riding horses with armour will have the horse armour removed
and dropped on the ground. Anyone trying to add horse armour whilst disabled will
get an error. Trying to ride a horse that has armour will make the armour fall off of the
horse.
